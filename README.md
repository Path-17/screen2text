# screen2text

A wrapper for flameshot that will extract text out of the screenshot

# How to use it
Run it, I use it as a global shortcut in KDE, then after selecting the flameshot screenshot area press Ctrl+c to copy the text in the screenshot to the screen

I use it primarily to be lazy when taking notes from live powerpoints and other forms of un-selectable text
